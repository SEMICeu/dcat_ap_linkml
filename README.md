# dcat-ap (LinkML)

A LinkML approximation of [SEMICeu DCAT-AP](https://github.com/SEMICeu/DCAT-AP)
3.0.1, built as a **continuous evaluation harness** for LinkML itself.

## What this is (and isn't)

This is a **scoping / demo schema**, not a production DCAT-AP profile. The
deliverable is the evaluation: by trying to reproduce the upstream SEMIC SHACL,
JSON-LD context, and HTML spec from a single LinkML source schema, we surface
exactly where LinkML can and can't express what DCAT-AP needs.

The findings live in [`COMPARISON.md`](COMPARISON.md) — a running ledger of
"what matches / what's missing / what LinkML can't yet express". Individual
gaps get filed as issues under [`issues/`](issues/) and (manually) cross-linked
to upstream [`linkml/linkml`](https://github.com/linkml/linkml) tickets.

## How it works

```
src/dcat_ap/schema/dcat_ap.yaml         ← the only hand-edited file
            │
            │  just gen-project / just gen-doc
            ▼
project/{shacl,owl,jsonschema,...}      ← generated artefacts
docs/elements/*.md                       ← generated documentation
src/dcat_ap/datamodel/*.py               ← generated Python / Pydantic
            │
            │  diff against
            ▼
original/releases/3.0.1/{shacl,context,html,...}   ← upstream truth
            │
            ▼
COMPARISON.md  + issues/issue_*.md       ← what's still off, and why
```

`original/` is a gitignored clone of <https://github.com/SEMICeu/DCAT-AP>;
refresh it with `git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/SEMICeu/DCAT-AP
original`. The clone is read-only — never edit it.

## LinkML version

The project intentionally pins both `linkml` and `linkml-runtime` to git
`linkml/linkml@main` (the linkml repo is now a uv workspace with both packages
under `packages/`). This is permanent: the whole point is to evaluate against
unreleased LinkML so we can see what *will* be possible, not just what is.
Pull the latest commits with:

```bash
uv sync --group dev --refresh
```

## Quick start

```bash
just install      # uv sync --group dev (LinkML from git@main)
just gen-project  # SHACL, OWL, JSON Schema, ShEx, Pydantic, dataclasses, ...
just gen-doc      # mkdocs sources under docs/
just test         # schema regen + pytest + linkml-run-examples
```

Run `just` with no arguments for the full recipe list.

## Iterative workflow

When something in DCAT-AP doesn't translate cleanly:

1. Document the gap in `COMPARISON.md`.
2. File it as `issues/issue_<topic>.md` (see the `track-issues` skill in
   `.claude/skills/`).
3. Work around it in the LinkML schema if a reasonable approximation exists.
4. Re-run the `align-model` skill against the latest LinkML `main` to check
   whether a recent merge has closed the gap.

Both skills (`align-model`, `track-issues`) are stored as Claude Code project
skills under `.claude/skills/` and are invoked automatically when their
triggering conditions match.
